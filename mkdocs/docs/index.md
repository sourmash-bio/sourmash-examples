# Welcome to the sourmash examples site!

This is a collection of examples and recipes for [the sourmash
software](https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/), for fast genomic and
metagenomic sequencing data analysis.

sourmash can quickly search genomes and metagenomes for matches; see
[our list of available search
databases](https://sourmash.readthedocs.io/en/latest/databases.html).

sourmash also supports taxonomic exploration and classification
for genomes and metagenomes with the NCBI and
[GTDB](https://gtdb.ecogenomic.org/) taxonomies.

The paper [Large-scale sequence comparisons with sourmash (Pierce et
al., 2019)](https://f1000research.com/articles/8-1006) gives an
overview of what sourmash does and how sourmash works.
